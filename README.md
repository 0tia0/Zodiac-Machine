## ❓ FAQ

#### What I need to re-create this project?

- You need the arduino we used, all the components and the 3d printed structure. So you can't only download and run this project.

#### Where can I find the component list and 3d model?

- Those stuff are not avaible yet, maybe in a next versione we will release those things

#### How much experience is required, in order to re-create this project?

- You will need a medium level of experience to use 3D printers and recreate a fairly complex circuit, so this is not a project for novices

## 📥 Installation

You must install and use PlatformIO, as we said in the [tech stack](https://github.com/0tia0/Zodiac-Machine?tab=readme-ov-file#-tech-stack)

To recreate this project, you will need to replicate all the connections shown in the electrical diagram, as well as 3D print the plastic structure. Unfortunately, as mentioned in the FAQ, the detailed information for this step has not yet been published on GitHub. It may be released in a future version.

At the moment, you'll find only the C++ code, which could be interesting for learning purposes. Additionally, there are several branches that demonstrate how we implemented the project step by step by joining the tiles.
## ⚙️ Deployment

To deploy this project press the down arrow button placed right to the run button on VSCode, then select **Upload**. The code will be automatically uploaded on the connected arduino

Shortcut: **Ctrl + Alt + U**
